1. Data Integration and Automation
A custom API was developed using Google Apps Script (JavaScript) to automate the ingestion of application data from CognitoForms into Google Sheets. This eliminated manual transfer steps and streamlined batch processing with minimal human intervention.

2. AI-Based Evaluation Models
NLP techniques were used to convert textual responses from CSOs into structured data. The evaluation system leveraged Naive Bayes (probabilistic classification), Random Forest (entropy-based), and KNN (pattern similarity) models to score applications on a 1â€“7 scale, deployed via Google Cloud APIs and automated with Python.

3. Interactive Visualization Dashboard
A dynamic dashboard was built in Looker Studio to visualize CSO financial data from Google Sheets, populated via Google Forms. It enables real-time filtering, trend analysis, and improves transparency in fund management.

4. Sustainable Digital Infrastructure
The project retained the Google ecosystem (Forms, Sheets, Looker Studio, Apps Script) instead of migrating to AWS/Azure, ensuring low learning curves, continuity, and ease of adoption for public-sector staff.

5. Alignment with UN SDGs
The solution supports SDG 16 (transparency), SDG 17 (partnerships), SDG 10 (reducing inequality), and SDG 9 (digital innovation in public institutions).
